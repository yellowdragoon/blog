summary: A personal reflection of the role ego plays in my life.

I think the most dangerous thing ego can do is build up a fragile self-image.

An image that can be easily shattered when something doesn't go your way.

Last summer, I had a humbling experience that I am very grateful for. It was an internship at IMC Trading, a global options trading firm. I worked as a software engineering intern in the Amsterdam office. The interview process was long and challenging, and I was elated when the offer email arrived in my inbox. I didn't really know what I was getting myself into, but I knew it wasn't going to be easy.

In the first week, I took classes about trading and market making with my peers, playing interactive games and taking quizzes. It was extremely fast-paced, and frankly, I felt like I was falling behind. Everyone seemed to be picking up the new knowledge almost instantly, and I hadn't a clue what was going on at times.

Up to this point in my life, I've always felt like I was able to keep ahead. I could keep ahead of, or at the very least at the same pace as my peers, from primary school, to secondary school, to university.

This was the first time when I felt truly out of my depth, my comfort zone. I was in the midst of some incredible minds, some of whom I could not hope to compete with.

But why compete? Each individual has their own set of unique skillsets, their personal superpowers. Perhaps I'm not as good of a Java or C++ programmer, but I can clearly and concisely communicate my thought process in solving a problem. Perhaps I'm not as strong of a chess player, but I've taught hundreds of people over years. Perhaps I'm not as good of a musician, but I've composed my own instrumental tracks for games.

One line I love from Naval Ravikant is "Escape Competition Through Authenticity", and I couldn't agree more. If you just look at one vertical, one specific skill, there will always be those that are superior. But look horizontally, across all of your skills, and there is only one of you. How best to use my unique edge to succeed in life is something I'm still in the process of figuring out, but so far I can say that it feels like the right thing to do.

I feel like a turning point in my life is realizing that there is so much that I have yet to learn. I now naturally avoid feeling too good when I get a compliment from someone. Because I understand that if I do, I'm really looking at myself from a fake perspective, a projection of another who will never understand me. That projection will inevitably create turmoil when some external force shatters it. And it always will, because how could I really understand everything?

So future me, don't grow complacent. There will always be more knowledge to understand, more experiences to reflect on, more mistakes to make. Keep building, keep learning, keep teaching.

Best Wishes,

Henry
