summary: A reflection on the flow state and the self.
---

How does one get his life into flow?

That state often described in sport where the body acts with no mind.
Where true art is discovered in oneself. Where the mind is transcended and thought fades away.

In my own life, I have encountered periodically such moments.
Where I know that one hundred percent of my latent ability is brought to the fore.

I think that flow is related to the concept of the self. Let me ask you this:

**_Who Are You?_**

Do you truly know who you are? Or is your perception of yourself only from a third-person perspective?

I think we are all constantly in the process of discovering the true self.
And I say process because I think there can be an end to such a journey.

Once one is living as the true self, their lives are perpetually in flow as there exists nothing holding his latent ability back.

The true self is something to be discovered, explored, unraveled, not something to be put on a pedestal, explicitly sought after, or gamified.

Much of this is intuitive. I am inspired tonight to write these words as reflecting on my recent experiences, I feel closer to the true self,
and I know this because internally, I feel a sense of clarity and peace starting to melt away the fears and doubts.

I have recently rediscovered the copy of [The Daily Stoic](https://www.librarything.com/work/17943661/t/The-Daily-Stoic-366-Meditations-on-Wisdom-Perseverance-and-the-Art-of-Living) on my bookshelf. It contains some ancient wisdom on problems which have plagued humanity since inception.
It's refreshing to see that even the emperors of Rome wrestle with such problems, and to read their genuine thoughts on the matter.

I know that I will discover my true self one day. It is just a matter of time.

Because what truly makes me happy is to see myself evolve and grow.
And what truly makes me miserable is squandering this mind and desire that I was born with.

Best Wishes,

Henry
