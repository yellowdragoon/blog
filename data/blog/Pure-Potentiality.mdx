summary: An exploration of the bounds of human potential.

Let's start with a diagram.

What does this represent? It's a graph of potential against time. And the shaded region represents the bounds of your potential.

I think your potential can be summarised as the simple formula of

Talent \* Enviornment,

thinking back to the age-old debate of nature vs nuture. I like to think of it as 50/50 in my mental model, but be it 50/50, or 40/60, it doesn't really matter to the topic at hand. All we need to know is that the split exists.

Back to potentiality. As you progress through life, you will start to realise more and more of your potential. But it also means that the range of your potential contracts.

/>

And here's the truly dangerous part: **you will never know where you stand in relation to your ultimate potential!**

From your perspective:

  style={{ width: '600px', height: 'auto' }}
/>

But in reality it (most likely) is something like this:

  style={{ width: '600px', height: 'auto' }}
/>

And here's the worst part: this effect compounds. The more you trade time for realised potential, the more unrealised potential you give up. And there is no way to stop this effect.

_"Henry, this is horrible news! Should I just curl up in a ball and give up?"_, I hear you exclaim. No, I don't think so. While this may come across as a bleak outlook, it's simply coming to an understanding with reality. And through understanding, we can see the path forward.

I think the most important thing to reach for that upper limit of your potential is _exposure_. When I look back at my own journey, I've been fortunate to have learned from some incredible peers and teachers, each one unlocking a broader worldview. At first, I had no goal. Then I just wanted to do well in school and go to a good university. Then I wanted a decent paying job. Then, the goal was to reach a point where I can financially support my family. Now, while that is still a short to medium term goal, I have set my sights on gaining ownership, equity of something, be it in a business as a founder/early stage engineer, or be it through my personal brand.

With each expansion of worldview, I can see a higher potentiality bound for myself in the future. Not my ultimate potential - you'd have to be a God to see that - but higher nonetheless.

I think the time in my 20's and 30's is incredibly valuable. Moreso than seems intuitive. When evaluating new opportunities for jobs/activities/commitments, I want to think: _"What could be the true opportunity cost for me?"_, instead of _"This seems good enough, why not?"_

Broaden your horizons. Don't be afraid to question the restrictive ceiling you've shackled yourself with. Seek to understand what's truly possible of you in this lifetime, as you only get one chance.

Don't waste your Pure Potentiality.

Best Wishes,

Henry
